The Machine Learning field has seen so much progress lately that all developers can now build real-life smart ML-integrating applications, not only data scientists and ML researchers.

With pre-trained models and just a few lines of code, ML APIs can analyze or transform our data. Moreover, thanks to meta-learning techniques, Cloud AutoML can customize these models, solve more specific problems, and provide insights tailored to our own needs.

We'll explore what any developer can do today and we'll even try to build a custom model altogether in a live demo. Don't put your smartphone in airplane mode!
