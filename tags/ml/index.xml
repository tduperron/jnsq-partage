      <description>The Machine Learning field has seen so much progress lately that all developers can now build real-life smart ML-integrating applications, not only data scientists and ML researchers.
 With pre-trained models and just a few lines of code, ML APIs can analyze or transform our data. Moreover, thanks to meta-learning techniques, Cloud AutoML can customize these models, solve more specific problems, and provide insights tailored to our own needs.
 We&amp;#8217;ll explore what any developer can do today and we&amp;#8217;ll even try to build a custom model altogether in a live demo.</description>

      <description>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (Arthur C Clarke). Well, Machine Learning can look like magic to most of us, but you don’t need to be a data scientist or an ML researcher to develop with ML. Let’s check it out!
 What about making your app smarter without any knowledge in AI? With pre-trained models and a few lines of code, Machine Learning APIs can analyze your data.</description>
